# jj33 (aka jj28 plus 5 :))

The "jj28" is a great keyboard, but using it everyday I was start missing cursors, e.g. in sequence like control-shift-left to select left word, or control-shift-end to select to end of line I was a bit "slow".

The good news to be on the minimum side is that you can still add keys being on a "small side"!

So here it is: cursors back. :)

Note: I was thinking that also adding backspace was a good idea (hence the name "plus 5"), but later on I found that this additional key on the first row was confusing and so I removed it again as a key in my personal keyboard. I left anyway in the code for someone that wants to try.
