# jj33 (aka jj28 plus 5 :))

The "jj28" version is a great keyboard, but using it everyday I was start missing some keys, e.g. in sequence like control-shift-left to select left word, or control-shift-end to select to end of line I was a bit "slow".

The good news to be on the minimum side is that you can still add keys being on a "small side"!

So here it is: cursors and backspace back. :)
