This is a "full featured" layout inspired from the smaller Super Micro gherkin and "jj28" sisters.

In addition to the default key layer, there is a function/numbers/symbols layer eaily activated with either one of the two "meta" (red) keys and containing almost all keyset missing. On top of this, activated with both meta keys, there a system layer where are placed media keys, mouse emulation, and numpad in addition to the printscreen/scrollock/pause. The below picture show all layers on the actual keys (if someone would be able to print these labels let me know! :)).

Notes:
- "Windows"/OS key is overlayed with the Esc one
- If needed to activate permanently the function/number/symbols layer you can use the "layer tap toggle" functionality (now set to the default 5 presses). For the system layer to be activated permanently is enough to hit shift in this layer (so with the two meta keys pressed).
- From system layer you can "jump" to an hidden lights layer pressing control key. Meta-Esc from function one or simply Esc from the other two and the layer is coming back to default key layer
