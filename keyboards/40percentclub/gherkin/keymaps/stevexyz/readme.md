# gherkin super micro edition

With this configuration the "28" layout first experimented on the plank-like jj40 is being ported to a more proper board, leaving just two keys not used.  For more information please have a look at https://github.com/stevexyz/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/jj40/keymaps/stevexyz/readme.md

With the last changes, this layout has been made compatible also to a "26" keys one, leaving just the letters on the keyboard, so you can now choose to leave all 30 keys on the keyboard or remove the two on the bottom line corners to have the 28 layout or remove also space and enters to have the simplest one possible that can be used without too much gimmick in my opinion... :)

The image below explains the main layers. In addition to them with q, w and e there are three specific dedicated layers for cursors/mouse, numpad and media.
