# The 25% SuperMicro keyboard: a pure "Alpha 26" keymap on Gherkin

With this configuration the "SuperMicro" layout first experimented on the plank-like jj40 is being ported to a more proper board.

With the last changes, this layout has been made compatible also to a "just alpha" (26) keys one; so you can now choose to leave all 30 keys on the keyboard, or remove the two on the bottom line corners to have the 28 layout, or remove also space and enter to have the simplest one!

Layout is for a generic usage, trying to avoid as much gimmick as possible (considering the number of keys) and retain muscle memory from people used to the standard Qwerty 104 one. Examples of design include symbols on the central row laid out in the same order as you'll find on the standard one, and the cursor movement aligned to the common unix vi standard ("hjkl", and for symmetry "sdfg" for home/pgdn/pgup/end). I've personally used it for months on my home PC together with my portable work PC.

The image below explains the main layers. In addition to them there are available 5 layouts that can be personalized as needed or completely removed without losing any functionality; three of them are currently setup in the default keymap for cursors/mouse, numpad and media (activated with q, w and e respectively).
